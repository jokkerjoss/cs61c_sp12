Problem 1: Basics Potpourri

1. The computer which used to run large problems and and usually was accessed via network - SERVER
2.2^50 bytes= 1 petabyte
<<<<<<< HEAD
Dev 2 - 3. The computers which are composed of hundreds to thousands of processors and terabytes of memory - SUPERCOMPUTERS
=======


4.The today`s science fiction application that will be available in the near future - VIRTUAL WORLDS
>>>>>>> Answered Q4 by jokkerjoss

Dev 2 - 5.The part of the computer called central processor unit - CPU

6.The memory called the random access memory - RAM
7. The desktop computer without screen or keyboard usually accessed via the network - LOW END SERVER
8. The microprocessor containing several processors in the same chip - MULTICORE PROCESSORS
9. Thousands of processors forming yhe large cluster - DATACENTER
10. Currently the largest class of computer that runs one application or one set of related applications - DESKTOP COMPUTER
11. Program that translates statements in high-level language to assembly language - COMPILER
12. Special language used to describe hardware components - MACHINE LANGUAGE
13. The personal computer delivering good performance to single users at low cost - DESKTOP COMPUTER
14. The program that translates symbolic instructions to binary instructions - ASSEMBLER
15. The high level language for scientific computation - FORTRAN
16. The commands that the processor unerstands - MACHINE LANGUAGE
17. The binary language that the processor can understand - MACHINE LANGUAGE
18. The high level language for business data processing - COBOL
19. The symbolic representation of machine instructions - BIT
20. The interface between userÂ´s program and hardware providing a variety of services and supervision functions - SYSTEM SOFTWARE
21. The software/programs developed by the users - APPLICATION SOFTWARE
22. The software layer between the application software and the hardware that includes the operating system and the compilers - SYSTEM SOFTWARE
23. The high-level language used to write application and system software - C 
23. The portable language composed of words and algebraic expressions that must be translated into assembly language before run in a computer - INSTRUCTION
24. The 2^40 bytes - TERABYTE
25. The binary digit (0 or 1) - BIT

b) If a computer connected to a 1 Gb Ethernet network needs to send a 256KB  files, how long would it take - 5 SECONDS

c) Assuming that a cache memory is tentimes faster than the DRAM memory, that DRAM is 100,000 times faster than magnetic disk, and that flash memory is 1000 times faster than disk, find how long it takes to read a file from a DRAM, a disk, and flash memory if it takes 2 microseconds from cache memory - 
20 MICROSECONDS from DRAM, 0.2 SECONDS from disk, 0,002 ms from the flash memory.
d) Lots of service providers boast about offering "five nines" of uptime in their service level agreements.
	1. It is meaning that about 99.999% uptime translates only 26 sec.
	2. They can tolerate downtime-__________  per year without breaking their SLA
e) The designs of the warehause scale computers need to be inherently fault-tolerant, because of too much data depends on them.
f) The Google uses desktop-grade hardware instead of the server-grade hardware, because of the PRICE.
